# RaylibEnetCodeBase
Code base for future game development currently has working tic tac toe
This repository serves as a code base for any future Raylib/Enet game I'd like to develop It lays out the groundwork for NAT traversal, client host logic and rendering levels. No actual Entity logic is inplace but can be added later on pretty easily.
This also allows the game to be detached from ENet or Raylib in case I need to do so in the future, So long as the networking library supports access to sockets where I can punch NAT
