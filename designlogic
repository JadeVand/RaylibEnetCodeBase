Maybe create a gamestate interface which has to implement update

CRITICAL:
Issue with crashing when queue is called repeatedly , hard to debug..

Solved:
The issue was when I would que up, the matchmaking server would push me into a que ,
When I would leave, it takes about 10 seconds for the server to remove me from the list
When I would reque the matchmaking server would match me up with my self because I was already
In the list, and so I would be stuck hole punching myself
maybe I should put a cool down to prevetn queing very fast?




Rollback logic
our simulation
frames:
27:[peer input: null][my input: x]
28:[peer input: null][my input: y]
29:[peer input: null][my input: z]

frame arrives
27:[peer input: x]

correction:
rollback to frame 27:
27:[peer input: x][my input: x]
prediction they'll still keep pressing x
28:[peer x: null][my input: y]
29:[peer x: null][my input: z]

draw is called:
draw(frame==29)
