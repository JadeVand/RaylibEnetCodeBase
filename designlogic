HostLogic ClientLogic thoughts:


I don't think we need to separate client logic and hostlogic

Rather we can use one separate class called ingamelogic

Then when we want to decide if and when to broadcast we can use ishost() which gets instantiated by NetLogic and will always choose correctly

Because right now hostlogic and clientlogic are pretty much doing the exact same thing which is unnecessary to have two classes and just copy and pasting data
