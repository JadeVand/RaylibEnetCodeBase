Classes:

ENetInterface 
    Interfaces with the ENet library for I/O and packets queing

Entity
    Holds player state information
HostLogic
    Runs server sided game logic (host only)
ClientLogiic
    Runs client sided game logic (client only)

Game
    Instantiates level pointers for which level is currently being draw
Level 
    The current level being rendered/drawn






Main instantiates two classes game and gamelogic

The reason these two need to be created separately is because gamelogic needs to be able to run its updates faster than game

Game takes a pointer to gamelogic and passes the pointer to level classes

When the correct level is created (gamelevel) it will call startlogic on the gamelogic object

Gamelogic will instantiate ENetInterface and handle packet I/O
